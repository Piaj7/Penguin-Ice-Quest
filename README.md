# Penguin-Ice-Quest
Penguin Ice Quest is a 2D side-scrolling platform game in which the player controls a penguin navigating through icy environments. The aim of the game is to collect fish, avoid enemies, and reach the end of each level. The project was developed as part of a Software Development module during my second year at the University of Hertfordshire. It demonstrates practical skills in game design, programming, testing, and project management.

## 1. Project Overview
Penguin Ice Quest is a 2D side-scrolling platform game in which the player controls a penguin navigating through icy environments. The aim of the game is to collect fish, avoid enemies, and minimise damage while progressing to the end of each level.

The player begins with three lives and must collect a required number of fish to unlock new levels. As the game progresses, levels increase in difficulty, introducing new challenges and obstacles.

The game concept was inspired by the mobile platform game Lep’s World. While inspired by Lep’s World, Penguin Ice Quest features original characters, environments, and gameplay mechanics
