# Penguin-Ice-Quest
Penguin Ice Quest is a 2D side-scrolling platform game in which the player controls a penguin navigating through icy environments. The aim of the game is to collect fish, avoid enemies, and reach the end of each level. The project was developed as part of a Software Development module during my second year at the University of Hertfordshire. It demonstrates practical skills in game design, programming, testing, and project management.

## 1. Project Overview
Penguin Ice Quest is a 2D side-scrolling platform game in which the player controls a penguin navigating through icy environments. The aim of the game is to collect fish, avoid enemies, and minimise damage while progressing to the end of each level.

The player begins with three lives and must collect a required number of fish to unlock new levels. As the game progresses, levels increase in difficulty, introducing new challenges and obstacles.

The game concept was inspired by the mobile platform game Lep’s World. While inspired by Lep’s World, Penguin Ice Quest features original characters, environments, and gameplay mechanics

## 2. Breakdown
This project was developed individually. All stages of development, including planning, implementation, testing, documentation, and evaluation, were completed independently.

## 3. Target Audience
### Primary Target Audience:
The primary target audience for Penguin Ice Quest is casual gamers aged 4 and above who enjoy 2D side-scrolling platform games similar to classic titles such as Mario.

The game is designed to be:
- Easy to learn and understand
- Suitable for short, casual play sessions
- Replayable, encouraging players to collect fish in order to progress to the next level
- Accessible for all skill levels
- Enjoyable for more experienced players

## 5. User Requirements
Users MUST be able to:
- Move left and right using keyboard controls
- Jump to reach platforms and avoid obstacles
- Collect fish pickups during gameplay
- Lose a life when colliding with an enemy or hazard
- Unlock and access the next level after collecting the required number of fish
- View the current number of lives remaining on the UI
- Restart the level after losing all lives
- Pause or quit back to the main menu

## 6. System Requirements
### Functional Requiremnts
The system must:
- Support player movement (left/right) and jumping using keyboard input
- Detect collisions between the player, platforms, enemies, hazards, and collectibles
- Increase the fish counter when a fish collectible is collected
- Decrease the player’s lives when the player collides with an enemy or hazard
- Trigger a Game Over state when the player’s lives reach zero
- Provide the player with the option to:
- Restart the current level
- Return to the main menu
- Trigger a level completion state when the player reaches the end of the level
- Unlock the next level when the required number of fish has been collected
- Display the fish counter and remaining lives on-screen during gameplay

### Non-Functional Requirements
The system should:
- Run smoothly with responsive controls and minimal input delay
- Maintain stable performance without crashes during gameplay
- Provide a clear and readable user interface
- Be structured using modular and organised Blueprints for maintainability
- Be scalable to allow future additions such as new levels or enemies

## 7. Game Rules & Mechanics
- The player begins each level with three lives.
- The player can move left and right and jump to navigate platforms.
- Fish collectibles are placed throughout the level and increase the player’s total fish count when collected.
- If the player collides with an enemy or hazard, one life is lost.
- When all lives are lost, the game enters a 'Game Over' state, where the player can choose to restart the level or return to the main menu.
- The level is completed when the player reaches the end goal area.
- A required number of fish must be collected to unlock the next level.
- Each new level may introduce increased difficulty, such as more enemies or more complex platform layouts.

## 8. Development Strategy
This software development project was developed using an Agile Scrum-based methodology. The whole development process was decomposed into short, manageable time periods called sprints. Each sprint focused on implementing and testing specific features of the game.

A product backlog was made at the start of the project to list all required features and tasks. These tasks were ordered based on importance and development difficulty. During each sprint, selected backlog items were implemented, tested, and reviewed.

Progress was monitored using weekly development logs and backlog reviews. Completed features were evaluated, and any issues were identified and resolved before progressing.

GitHUb was used for regular commits and backups throughout development. This helped to track changes and reduce the risk of any work getting lost or corrupt.

### Advantages
The use of an Agile approach allowed flexibility during development, enabling features to be improved or adjusted based on testing results and time constraints.

### Disadvantages
Planning and reviewing sprints alone required strong self-discipline and time management. Some features had to be simplified or postponed due to limited development time within each sprint. Maintaining detailed documentation alongside development was time-consuming because I was developing alone.
