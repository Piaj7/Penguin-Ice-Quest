# Penguin-Ice-Quest
Penguin Ice Quest is a 2D side-scrolling platform game in which the player controls a penguin navigating through icy environments. The aim of the game is to collect fish, avoid enemies, and reach the end of each level. The project was developed as part of a Software Development module during my second year at the University of Hertfordshire. It demonstrates practical skills in game design, programming, testing, and project management.
